## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 response has been largely regional and state-based in nature. Some states have enacted strictly enforced stay-at-home policies, while others have provided general guidelines.  Do stay-at-home policies prevent increases in positive cases? In comparing regional responses to COVID-19, what is the general public sentiment in response to state policies?
